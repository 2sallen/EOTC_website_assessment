            <h1>Summary:</h1> 
            
            <p>Students will spend the day in a small group with their friends, helping out local residents and businesses. This activity focuses on building citizenship, and students have had a lot of fun with it in previous years. They might be helping the elderly with gardening or painting, assisting local food banks and charities, or even helping out at a local school or kindergarten for the day.</p>

            <p>Each group will be supervised by a staff member, and most will be travelling somewhere within walking distance of Tawa College. Those that have further to go may be driven there by their supervisor.</p>

            <p>Students will meet in the school gym at 9:15am, and should bring all the usual things (list available on the <a href="about.html#gearlist">About</a> page). They should also make sure they are wearing clothes appropriate for gardening or painting and closed-toed shoes.</p>

            <p>After lunch, students will spend a couple of hours at the pool. If students are not swimming, there will be a side area for them to relax in. The group will then catch the 2:39pm train back to Tawa station, where they will be dismissed.</p>

            <p>If students live in Porirua, they may meet us at Adrenalin Forest, and should be waiting at the entrance by TBDam. There they will be met by the rest of the group, and must let a teacher know they are there so they can be marked off on the roll. They may also be dismissed from the pool at 2:15pm, if they live in the local area. This must be indicated on the permission form.</p>
