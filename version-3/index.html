                <p>Students will meet at Tawa train station at 8:15am, at which time the roll will be taken. If you arrive after that time, you need to make sure to tell a teacher so they know you are here.
Students will be catching the 8:28am train to Porirua. If anyone is absolutely unable to catch this train, there will be a teacher at the station catching the 8:48am train. This is only for students who cannot possibly make the earlier train, and they will not get the full 3 hours of climbing.
After lunch, students will spend a couple of hours at the pool. If students are not swimming, there will be a side area for them to relax in.
The group will then catch the 2:39pm train back to Tawa station, where they will be dismissed.
