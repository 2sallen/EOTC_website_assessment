            <p>Students will spend the day traversing the Rangituhi walkway, going via the lookout and the summit, then descending into Te Ngahere o Tawa. This is a lovely walk with plenty of native bush. Along the way, students will learn about the plants and animals around them, and improve their skills at map-reading. There will also be activities during the walk, the winner of which gets a $50 prezzy card!</p>

            <p>A bus will transport students to the start, and they will be supervised by staff members throughout.</p>
