            <h1>Summary:</h1> 
            
            <p>Students will spend 3 hours climbing and challenging themselves on the high ropes course at Adrenalin Forest. This involves ropes, ziplines, ladders, and more, at varying heights above the forest floor. After this, there will be a break for lunch, before students will go to Te Rauparaha arena, where they will have use of the whole building, including the main pool, spas, sauna, steam room, hydroslide and deep water swimming lane.</p>

            <p>In addition to the <a href="about.html#gearlist">general list</a>, students must bring: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Swimgear (togs & towel)</li>
                <li>Appropriate clothes for climbing (not too baggy, no denim)</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Details:</h1>
                            
            <p>Students will meet at Tawa train station at 8:15am, at which time the roll will be taken. If you arrive after that time, you need to make sure to tell a teacher so they know you are here.</p>

            <p>Students will be catching the 8:28am train to Porirua. If anyone is absolutely unable to catch this train, there will be a teacher at the station catching the 8:48am train. This is only for students who cannot possibly make the earlier train, and they will not get the full 3 hours of climbing.</p>

            <p>After lunch, students will spend a couple of hours at the pool. If students are not swimming, there will be a side area for them to relax in. The group will then catch the 2:39pm train back to Tawa station, where they will be dismissed.</p>

            <p>If students live in Porirua, they may meet us at Adrenalin Forest, and should be waiting at the entrance by TBDam. There they will be met by the rest of the group, and must let a teacher know they are there so they can be marked off on the roll. They may also be dismissed from the pool at 2:15pm, if they live in the local area. This must be indicated on the permission form.</p>
