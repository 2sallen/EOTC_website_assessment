            <p>Students will be split into 4 groups to do the activities. Each group will do each activity on a different day. Every group will do every activity, so no one misses out. Each student will be given a timetable informing them of which trip they will do on which day. If you know which group you are in, you can also use the following links to view your timetable:</p>

            <p>These activities will take place from the 3rd through 6th of December (Tuesday-Friday). All trips will return to Tawa College by 3:20pm. Meeting time and location is different for each activity, so make sure you check for each day. The total cost of the trips is $75 per student. This must be paid to the school office, or by internet banking (see <a href="contact.html#contact" >Contact & Forms</a> page), by Friday the 25th of October.

            <p>All these activities are compulsory, but have been designed to be both educational and fun. Students will be supervised at all times by Tawa College staff. Make sure you have filled out and returned the permission forms and paid the $75 by Friday the 35th of October. See the <a href="contact.html">Contact & Forms</a> page for more details.</p>

            <h1>Rules:</h1>
                            
            <p>Students will not be allowed to participate in these trips if they do not have the correct gear. If you have any difficulty supplying these required items please indicate on the return form and we will do our best to assist.</p>

            <p>Students must follow the school rules on all trips. This includes absolutely no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol. Students are also expected to be respectful to both the supervising teachers and other students.</p>

            <p>It is essential that all students on the trip play their part in risk management. Their personal safety is very much their responsibility and they must always act in a manner that does not endanger either themselves or others. This includes following the instructions of staff at all times.</p>
            
            <p>Anyone who does not comply with these requirements will be sent back to school and/or home at the expense of their parents/caregivers.</p>
