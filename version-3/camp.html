            <h1>Summary:</h1>

            <p>Students will spend two days at camp Wainui, sleeping one night in tents with their friends. On the first day, they will rotate through a series of fun activities at the campsite as small groups. These activities are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Raft building</li>
                <li>Emergency bivvy making</li>
                <li>Search and rescue</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the second day, they will take a day pack and walk along the Orongorongo track. This is a lovely walk in the Remutaka valley, and has lots of beautiful native bush. Along the way, students will learn about the native plants around them, and improve their map-reading skills.</p>
            <p>At the end of the track is a braided river with lovely views of the hills around it. When students reach it, they will learn to make fires on the riverbed, and maybe toast some marshmallows. If the river is not too high, they will also learn about river-crossing safely. After lunch, they will walk back along the track and return to camp.</p>

            <h1>Details:</h1>
                            
            <p>Students meet with their form class in front of the school hall at 8:30am. They will then take a bus to camp. After pitching their tents, they will begin the day’s activities. Dinner will be provided, which is chili mince with pasta, and ice cream for dessert. After dinner, there will be free time until lights out at 9:30pm. After lights out, students must remain in their own tents.</p>

            <p>On the second day, they will be provided with toast and cereal for breakfast, before taking down their tents and setting off on the walk with their day packs. After they return, they will catch a bus back to school, where they will be released around 3:30pm.</p>

            <p>The campsite has toilets, a few showers, and a hall which we will use for dining. Use of showers is strongly discouraged, as 260 people would take a long time to shower, and we are only there for one night. There is very limited cell phone coverage, so if you need to contact your child in an emergency, you may contact the school during school hours, or Camp Wainui after hours. Phone numbers available on the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
